             <h1>Introduction</h1>
             <p class="p-3"><span class="h6 text-black">Abraham Benjamin de Villiers</span> (born 17 February 1984) is a South African former international cricketer, and a current commentator. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year[2] three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.[3] He is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport and as one of the best batsmen of his era.[4][5] De Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order.</p>
             <p class="p-3">Regarded as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.[6] He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played a One Day International (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.[7] In limited overs cricket, he is an attacking player.[8] He holds the record for the fastest ODI fifty (16 balls), fastest ODI century (31 balls), and fastest ODI 150 (62 balls).</p>

             <h1>Early Life</h1>
             <p class="p-3">Abraham Benjamin de Villiers was born on 17 February 1984 in Warmbad (modern day Bela-Bela), South Africa to Abraham B de Villiers and Millie de Villiers. He has two elder brothers Jan de Villiers and Wessels de Villiers.[18] He described his childhood days as "really relaxed lifestyle up there, where everyone knows everyone".[19] He was educated at Afrikaanse HoÃ«r Seunskool in Pretoria along with teammate Faf du Plessis, who was and still remains his good friend. He is a high school graduate. His father was a doctor who had played rugby union in his youth, and he encouraged his son to play sports as a child.[19]</p>

           <div id="career" class="container-fluid bg-secondary text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
             <h1>Career</h1>
             <p class="p-3">De Villiers is a right-handed batter who accumulated 8765 runs in Tests including 22 centuries and 46 fifties. He holds the record for most Test innings without registering a duck (78),[20] before being dismissed for nought against Bangladesh in November 2008. He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with an unbeaten 278. Until 2012 he was an occasional wicket-keeper for South Africa, although after the retirement of regular Test keeper Mark Boucher and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to debutant Quinton de Kock.</p>
             <p class="p-3">He holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen, and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is. He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015.</p>
             <p class="p-3">After the 2011 Cricket World Cup he succeeded Graeme Smith as captain of the national ODI side,[21] and became Test captain after the second Test of the home series against England in 2015/16.[22] He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period.[23]</p>
             <p class="p-3">AB de Villiers is claimed by many to be a multifaceted, versatile sportsperson, having excelled in various sports such as golf, rugby, tennis, and hockey.[24] But AB himself admitted that he was never good in other sports except cricket like what others claim to be and also insisted that he never considered himself as a child prodigy.[25] He insisted that he was pretty decent at rugby and golf but refused to admit that he held national records in swimming.[26] He openly made such statements to public and has also mentioned it in his autobiography titled AB: The Autobiography, in response to the "falsehoods and exaggerations" about his all-round abilities.[27]</p>

           <div id="interCareer" class="container-fluid bg-warning text-black" style="padding:100px 20px;">
               <h1>International Career</h1>
               <p class="p-3">After a spell in the South Africa U19 team, he made his debut for the Titans in 2003/4.
                He made his Test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 November 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made a strong impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second Test and also handed the wicket-keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match-saving half-century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final Test of the series.</p>
                <p class="p-3">Despite a good tour of the Caribbean where he scored 178 to help South Africa seal a Test series win, his rapid progress was slowed on the tour of Australia in 2005. Despite playing Shane Warne well and becoming the second-youngest and second-fastest South African to reach 1,000 Test runs after Graeme Pollock, he struggled and made just 152 runs in 6 innings. De Villiers was back in form soon and gave the selectors a sign by producing his then highest one-day score of 92 not out, which included 12 fours and one six, from 98 balls against India in the 2006 winter series.</p>
                <p class="p-3">De Villiers had a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who was also one of the finest fielders of his generation. His fielding positions other than wicket-keeper were first and second slip and cover.[28]</p>

           <div id="record" class="container-fluid bg-info text-white" style="padding:100px 20px;">
               <h1>Record Breaking Year</h1>
               <p class="p-3">On 18 January 2015, de Villiers scored both the fastest fifty and the fastest century by a batsman in One Day International cricket, off 16 balls and 31 balls respectively and eventually scoring 149 runs off 44 balls in 59.5 minutes[45] against West Indies.[46]</p>
           </div>
           <div id="retirement" class="container-fluid bg-danger text-black" style="padding:100px 20px;">
               <h1>Retirement</h1>
               <p class="p-3">On 6 January 2016, the second Test match between England and South Africa ended in a draw. After the end of the match, Hashim Amla resigned from the captaincy and de Villiers was chosen to captain South Africa for the last two matches.[52]</p>
               <p class="p-3">On 21 February 2016, de Villiers scored the fastest T20I fifty by a South African, in just 21 balls. He completed the innings with 79 runs in 29 balls and led South Africa to a clean sweep in the T20I series.</p>
               <p class="p-3">On 18 January 2017, de Villiers ruled himself out from most of the Test matches and ultimately played in December 2017.[53][54] However, a day before the Test match, Faf du Plessis picked up a viral infection, putting him in doubt for the match.[55] On the morning of the Test, he was ruled out of the fixture, with AB de Villiers replacing him as captain.[56] He also kept wicket during the match, as South Africa's wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock suffered a hamstring injury while batting on day one.[57] He took eight catches in the match and the Test match finished inside two days, with South Africa winning by an innings and 120 runs.[58]</p>
               <p class="p-3">De Villiers returned for the Indian tour to South Africa in 2018. He stated he had given up wicket-keeping as his back could no longer handle the demand, and Faf du Plessis resumed his role as captain in all forms of the game.[59][60]</p>
               <p class="p-3">In the second Test match against Australia, he scored his 22nd Test century with a score of 126 not out off 146 balls in the first innings. His performance helped the team win the match by 6 wickets.[61]</p>
               <p class="p-3">On 23 May 2018, de Villiers announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket through a video uploaded to Twitter, in which he explained his decision.[62][63] One of the statements in his monologue was "I have had my turn, and to be honest, I am tired."[64] A few weeks after his announcement about retiring from international cricket, he clarified and said that he will continue playing T20 leagues for a few more years.[65] During the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, and following South Africa losing their first three matches in the tournament, details emerged of de Villiers making himself available for selection for the national team squad on the day the squad was to be announced. He was not selected as he had not played any international cricket for his country leading up to the tournament, despite having been prompted to do so by South Africa's coach Ottis Gibson earlier in the year.[66][67]</p>
               <p class="p-3">In January 2020, it was rumoured that de Villiers was in talks to make a comeback to the South African T20I side for the 2020 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. De Villiers,[68] as well as South African director of cricket Graeme Smith[69] and head coach Mark Boucher,[70] confirmed these rumours.</p>
               <p class="p-3">In November 2020, de Villiers was nominated for the Sir Garfield Sobers Award for ICC Male Cricketer of the Decade, and the award for ODI cricketer of the decade.[71][72]</p>

               <h1>International Centuries</h1>
               <p class="p-3">De Villiers has scored 22 Test and 25 ODI centuries. He scored his first Test century against England in 2005 and his first ODI century against West Indies in 2007. He also holds the world record for the fastest 100 and 150 in One-Day Internationals.</p>
